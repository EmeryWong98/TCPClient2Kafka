# TCPClient2Kafka
This project implements the deployment of Kafka and Zookeeper images to a server using Docker containers. By running the generated jar package, it retrieves real-time AIS information of ships transmitted by a remote TCP server and stores it in a Kafka topic. The configuration of the Kafka topic can be further added later.
